# Quantum-Enhanced Language Model (QELM) Neuron

Welcome to the **Quantum-Enhanced Language Model (QELM) Neuron repository! This project leverages quantum computing and neural 
network-inspired architectures to explore advanced language processing using **Qiskit** and quantum hardware simulators.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

QELM Neuron is a cutting-edge framework designed to train and simulate quantum-enhanced language models by integrating the following components:

1. **Quantum Neuron (20-Qubit Logical Unit)**:
   - Logical qubit encoding with error correction.
   - Parameterized gates for efficient quantum processing.

2. **Graphene-Like Layer Structure**:
   - Multi-neuron hexagonal lattice inspired by graphene.
   - Entangled neurons for brain-like connectivity.

3. **Stacked Quantum Layers**:
   - Deep architectures for scalable language models.
   - Inter-layer entanglement for enhanced quantum computations.

4. **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Training**:
   - Classical embedding and output layers.
   - Quantum neural networks for intermediate computations.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run the project, ensure the following Python dependencies are installed:

- `qiskit`
- `qiskit-aer`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `nltk`

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QELM.git
   cd QELM
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python qelm.py
   ```

3. During execution, the script will:
   - Initialize the QELM model with reduced parameters for simulation.
   - Train the model using synthetic datasets.
   - Save the trained model (`quantum_llm.qelm`).
   - Evaluate the model for fidelity and predictions.

4. Customize model parameters, dataset paths, or training settings directly in the script.

## 📈 Training and Evaluation

- **Synthetic Dataset**:
  Generate a dataset with:
  ```python
  X, Y = create_synthetic_dataset(vocab_size=16, num_samples=100)
  ```

- **Real Dataset**:
  Load a real dataset from a text file:
  ```python
  X, Y, token_to_id = load_real_dataset(file_path="data.txt", vocab_size=5000)
  ```

- **Train the Model**:
  Update `epochs` and `learning_rate` for your needs in:
  ```python
  train_quantum_model(qlm, X, Y, epochs=10, learning_rate=0.01)
  ```
